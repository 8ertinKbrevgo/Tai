The movie begins with Maya (Rani Mukerji) meeting Dev (Shah Rukh Khan) moments before she is about to marry Rishi (Abhishek Bachchan), her childhood friend. Dev is a successful soccer player who is married to Rhea (Preity Zinta), a fashion magazine editor. Maya and Dev feel an instant connection, but they part ways after a brief conversation.
 
Soon after, Dev meets with an accident that injures his leg and ends his soccer career. He becomes bitter and resentful towards Rhea, who continues to work and support him. Maya, on the other hand, is unhappy in her marriage with Rishi, who loves her but does not understand her. She also suffers from infertility and feels guilty for not giving Rishi a child.
 
Four years later, Dev and Maya meet again at a train station. They recognize each other and start talking. They realize that they are both unhappy in their marriages and decide to help each other fix their relationships. They become friends and start meeting regularly.
 
However, their friendship soon turns into love, as they find in each other what they are missing in their spouses. They try to resist their feelings, but they are too strong to ignore. They begin an affair, which causes more problems in their marriages.
 
Rhea and Rishi suspect their partners of cheating on them and confront them. Dev and Maya admit their affair and ask for a divorce. Their spouses are devastated and angry. They also face opposition from their families, especially from Dev's mother Kamal (Kirron Kher) and Rishi's father Sam (Amitabh Bachchan), who are friends and try to save their children's marriages.
 
Dev and Maya move out of their homes and start living together. They hope to find happiness with each other, but they soon realize that they have hurt too many people and themselves in the process. They feel guilty and conflicted about their decision. They also face social stigma and isolation for being adulterers.
 
They decide to end their relationship and part ways for good. They apologize to their spouses and families and try to move on with their lives. However, they still love each other and cannot forget each other.
 
The movie ends with a twist, as Dev and Maya meet again after three years at another train station. They are both divorced and single. They smile at each other and hug, implying that they might get back together.
